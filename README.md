# ROS 2 with Python Turtle 

This is a trail on ROS 2, the Robot Operating System, through the Python Turtle module. Inside this repository, you will find completed scripts inside the 'example/' directory.  

This is a evaluation trial on Robot Operating System (ROS) and Robot Raconteur (RR) using python turtle module. Participants are provided with ready-to-run example scripts, and the goal upon completion is to integrate those standalone python codes with ROS/RR and control the on screen turtle with a webcam.
