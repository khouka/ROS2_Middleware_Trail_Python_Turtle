# ROS 2 Actions Survey

## What this is:
This is an extension to the ROS 2 Trial. There are three forms of communication in ROS: topics, services, and actions. In the previous trial you mastered the topics and services. Here, you will learn how to use the actions. Actions are comparable to services. Likes services, Action clients send a request to an action server in order to achieve some goal and will get a result. Unlike services, while the action is being performed an action server sends progress feedback to the client.
