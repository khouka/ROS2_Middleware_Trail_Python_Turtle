# ROS 2 with Python Turtle 

This is a trail on ROS 2, the Robot Operating System, through the Python Turtle module. You will find completed scripts inside the `ROS2/src/Examples/`directory. Use them to flow through the trial's tasks. You will also find a `webcam/` directory, which will be explained later on. There will be further instructions on how to progress throughout this script and the two other to come, inside the `ROS/src/` directory. For now proceed by reading this script, if you encounter any issues throughout the trail feel free to ask questions through (https://answers.ros.org/questions/ask/).
