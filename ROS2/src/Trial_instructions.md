# ROS 2 Survey 

The Robot Operating System is a set of software libraries for building robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, ROS 2 has what you need for your next robotics project. And itâ€™s all open source. The primary system of ROS 2 consists of the correlation between publishers and Subscribers through nodes. The goal of this trail is to integrate the examples given and the sub-concepts of ROS 2 to create different python turtle nodes. The final task will require you to use the webcam examples provided and create a client/server function where you move the turtle using the webcam.
